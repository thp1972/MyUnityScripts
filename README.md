# MyUnityScripts
If I'll have time, here I put many useful scripts for the amazing **Unity** editor :)
## Contents
- **GameObjectSeparators**. With this script you'll have a menu *GameObject > Create Separator...* to create a separator/divider between game objects in the Hierarchy window. This was inspired from a [tip](https://twitter.com/CiroContns/status/901932711161589765) by Ciro Contisio.
## Usage
For a script that is an **Unity Editor Extension** simply put it into **Editor** folder.
