# MyUnityScripts
If I'll have time, here I put many useful scripts for the amazing **Unity** editor :)
## Contents
- **GameObjectSeparators**. Here, there is the script **GOSeparators.cs** that generates a menu item *GameObject > Create Separator...*. When used it creates a separator/divider between game objects in the Hierarchy window. This was inspired from a [tip](https://twitter.com/CiroContns/status/901932711161589765) by [Ciro Continisio](https://twitter.com/CiroContns).
## Usage
For a script that is an **Unity Editor Extension** simply put it into **Editor** folder.
