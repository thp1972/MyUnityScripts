## Contents
- **SceneSelector**. The script **SceneSelector.cs** generates a menu item *Assets > Select Scene* "dynamically" populated by all the scenes that can be used in the current project.
## Usage
- Put the script into **Editor** folder.
## Note
- The script also generates a file, **SceneMenuItems.cs**, which contains the menu items that represent the scenes. This file is automatically updated if a scene in the _Project Window_ is **added**, **removed**, **renamed** or **moved**. After writing the file, the *Assets > Select Scene* menu will be automatically recreated....
